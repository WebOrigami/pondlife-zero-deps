This project is a variation of the [pondlife](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pondlife) sample blog. That blog is written in the Origami language; this project here accomplishes the same result in JavaScript with zero dependencies.

See this [blog post](https://jan.miksovsky.com/posts/2025/04-17-zero-dependencies.html) for more details.
